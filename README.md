# VUE3 crypto exchange --> not my creation. 

Einstein Yap here, this is a crypto exchange Vue 3 template that I bought from themeforest. Initially unable to install.
after some fixed it can run for a sample test. 



## Project setup
```
npm install --> try it first. 
```

If NPM install cannot run at all use the following steps,
1)create a new VUE3 without ESLINT (for fast testing purpose),
 
2)Copy the src folder ( no need include the JSON file) to the newly create Vue3 from vue-cli
then try to install the following. 

npm i bootstrap
npm i vue3-carousel
npm i vue-trading-view


### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
